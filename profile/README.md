Pandora network is a distributed uncensorable smart contract & computing multi-layer network build with LNP/BP protocols (Bitcoin, Lightning, [RGB](https://github.com/RGB-WG), [Bifrost]](https://github.com/LNP-WG), [Prometheus]](https://github.com/Prometheus-WG), [Storm](https://github.com/Storm-WG)) created and maintained by [Pandora Prime SA](https://github.com/pandora-prime).

Its key value proposition is combination of scalability and strong confidentiality (which implies strong censorship-resistant properties).

It's key abilities are:
- Multiparty trustless smart contracts
- Multiparty generic computing (including machine learning)
- Decentralized data storage
- Efficient messaging

Its **first layer** consists of two domains: bitcoin blockchain and Pandora RNA - a sidechain designed for use with client-side-validation.

The **second layer** consists of a federation of Lightning nodes, operating Bifrost protocol. These nodes maintain a set of multi-peer channels.

The **third layer** is a reputation-based layer, composed of a subnetwork of lightning nodes operating Storm and Prometheus protocols and providing decentralized search and computing services.

The forth, application layer, provides following services, based on the layers underneath:
- Curated asset catalog, for the use by wallets, exchanges and other asset market players;
- Oracles for DLC and RGB contracts;
- Liquidity pools on Lightning network and a set of DEX nodes with ability to stake bitcoins and earn share in DEX operation profits;
- Search over decentralized storm network ("duckduckgo for lightning");
- Simplified decentralized search, storage and computing (including machine learning) APIs using pools of storage and computing providers from the layer three;
- Decentralized market for data and computing models.
